// B2B Marketing / Lead-gen — spend + funnel model. fct_ad_spend gives the cost
// side by channel/campaign; fct_touchpoints records each marketing touch with a
// per-touch credit weight; the funnel runs dim_lead → fct_opportunities
// (MQL → SQL → Closed-Won) so spend can be tied to closed revenue.
//
// Goal coverage (niche "leadgen"):
//   MQL→SQL→Won conversion  → fct_opportunities (is_mql, is_sql, is_won) by cohort
//   cost per SQL by channel → fct_ad_spend.cost × fct_opportunities.is_sql via lead source
//   touch → closed revenue  → fct_touchpoints.touch_credit × fct_opportunities.amount
//   mid-market cycle length → fct_stage_transitions × dim_account.employee_band
//   pipeline velocity       → fct_stage_transitions.days_in_from_stage × win-rate × ACV
