// B2B Sales / RevOps — CRM pipeline model, the shape of a Salesforce rollup.
// fct_opportunities is the deal header; fct_stage_transitions its movement
// history (cycle length, slippage); fct_opportunity_products the line items
// behind ACV; activities and quota attainment close the rep-productivity loop.
//
// Goal coverage (niche "b2b_sales"):
//   win rate w/o discounts  → fct_opportunities (is_won, discount_pct) by segment
//   cycle bottlenecks       → fct_stage_transitions.days_in_from_stage
//   forecast & slippage     → fct_opportunities.forecast_category × close_date shifts
//   quota attainment/ramp   → fct_quota_attainment × dim_rep.is_ramped
//   ACV via multi-product   → fct_opportunity_products line mix per deal
