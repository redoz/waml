// SaaS / Subscription — B2B recurring-revenue model. The centrepiece is
// fct_subscription_events: one row per MRR movement, which reconstructs the
// new/expansion/contraction/churn waterfall and feeds NRR/GRR. Usage, invoices
// and support hang off the account dimension as leading churn/expansion signals.
//
// Goal coverage (niche "saas"):
//   NRR > 110%              → fct_subscription_events.mrr_delta by event_type
//   90-day churn            → fct_subscription_events × dim_account.signup_date
//   trial-to-paid           → fct_trials (is_converted) × fct_subscription_events
//   CAC payback < 12m       → fct_marketing_spend × new-business MRR by channel cohort
//   expansion MRR           → fct_subscription_events (upgrades) + fct_usage_daily signals
